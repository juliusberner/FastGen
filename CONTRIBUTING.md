# Contributing to FastGen

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FastGen!

## Issue Tracking

* All enhancement, bugfix, or change requests should begin with the creation of an issue.
* The issue should be reviewed and approved prior to code review.

## Development Setup

All development should be done using the provided Docker image to ensure a consistent environment.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t fastgen:dev .

# Run interactively with GPU support (as current user, not root)
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    -e HOME=/workspace \
    -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro \
    -v /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
    -v $(pwd):/workspace \
    fastgen:dev bash

# Inside the container, install linters
make install
```

## Code Style and Formatting

FastGen uses **Ruff** for linting and code formatting. Follow existing conventions when adding new code.

```bash
make format  # Auto-format code
make lint    # Check compliance
```

**Note:** The `fastgen/third_party/` directory is excluded from checks.

## Continuous Integration

The GitHub CI pipeline (currently disabled) consists of three stages:

| Stage | Commands |
|-------|----------|
| Lint | `make lint`, `make mypy` |
| Test | `make pytest` |
| Install | `make install-fastgen` |

**Note:** Before submitting a pull request, ensure all checks pass locally.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository (for external contributors) or create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes following the code style guidelines.
3. Run all checks locally (see [CI section](#continuous-integration)).
4. Commit your changes with sign-off (PRs with unsigned commits will not be accepted):
   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "Add feature X"
   ```
5. Push and create a Pull Request.

**Note:** Keep PRs focused on a single concern and reference related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
